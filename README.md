# Invader

<h2>Description</h2>


Invader is a shooter game based on the game 'Halley Wars' for Game Gear developed by Taito. The arrow keys are used to move the ship, the INSERT key to shoot and the DELETE key to throw bomb. At the menu of the game all actions are performed using mouse. Initially, the Invader game was developed under MS-DOS but due this operating system is not currently used anymore, Invader was adapted to Windows using SDL libraries.
